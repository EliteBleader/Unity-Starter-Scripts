# Unity-Starter-Scripts
A repository with a bunch of useful scripts with different features to fit different genre of games. 

I'd say my C# skill level is intermediate so a lot of it may be Spaghetti code.
You can use it wherever no credit is needed.

A lot of it like the third person controller has a lot of scripts suited for my game. You may have to delete unwanted variables, methods etc.
